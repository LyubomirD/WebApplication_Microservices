# WebApplication Microservices Hub
Welcome to the central hub for the WebApplication with a microservices architecture. This repository serves as a convenient access point to all the remote repositories housing the various microservices that constitute the WebApplication ecosystem. Here, you'll find links to each individual microservice repository for exploration and inspection.

# Frontend Files:
- Fronted: https://github.com/LyubomirD/FrontendWebApplication  
The frontend components of the WebApplication are designed to deliver a seamless user experience. This is where users interact with the application's features and functionalities.

# Eureka Server:  
- Eureka Server: https://github.com/LyubomirD/WebEurekaServer    
Eureka main function is to find, manage and provide communication between microservices. 

# Microservices:
Each microservice contributes a unique and essential function to the overall WebApplication. Here are the microservices that power the application:

- Gateway API: https://github.com/LyubomirD/WebApplication_GatewayApi  
  The entry point that efficiently routes requests to different microservices based on the URL paths.

- Login / Sign up API: https://github.com/LyubomirD/Microservice_Login_SignUp  
  Handles user authentication and account registration, ensuring secure access to the application.

- User Account Information API:  
  Manages user profiles and personal information, allowing for customization and personalization.

- Products API:  
  Offers product-related services, enabling users to browse, search, and interact with available products.

- Payment API:  
  Facilitates seamless and secure payment transactions for users purchasing products or services.

By organizing these microservices, the WebApplication achieves modularity, scalability, and easier maintenance. Each microservice can be independently developed, tested, and deployed, providing a flexible and efficient architecture.

Feel free to explore the individual microservices by following the provided links to their respective repositories. This approach ensures clarity, accessibility, and a comprehensive understanding of the WebApplication's architecture.
